# Log into Accounts

For the platforms Instagram, Youtube, and Tiktok, log in to a brand new account which requires
setting of email, password, code justification(from your email), and birthday. For birthday, I used 2000/1/1 for all of them.

Emails should be aol for instagram and tiktok, and gmail for youtube. Other emails might be prone to security checks and blocks.
You should ensure that the browser which contains your login information is the browser you opened and operated last for the code to open the url in the corresponding accounts.


# Plain strategy

For plain strategy to work, you will have 50 videos played for each platform and each media.
So you will need 9 accounts created for thoes plain strategies.
